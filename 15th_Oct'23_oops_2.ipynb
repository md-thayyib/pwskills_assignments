        "### 1. Inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass/derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (base class/parent class). The subclass can reuse, extend, or override the functionalities of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Significance:**\n",
        "- Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing the reuse of attributes and methods from existing classes.\n",
        "- Modularity: It facilitates a modular approach to design, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
        "- Polymorphism: Inheritance contributes to polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Single Inheritance vs. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Single Inheritance:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "dog.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
        "dog.bark()   # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def method_A(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Method A\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class B:\n",
        "    def method_B(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Method B\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A, B):\n",
        "    def method_C(self):\n",

        "obj.method_C()  # Output: Method C\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Example of Inheriting from `Vehicle` to `Car`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Vehicle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, color, speed):\n",
        "        self.color = color\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Overriding `speak()` Method in `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "- Constructors are inherited implicitly in Python.\n",
        "- If a subclass doesn't have its own `__init__` method, it will automatically call the constructor of the parent class.\n",

        "1. **Concept of Encapsulation in Python and its Role in OOP:**\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class.\n",
        "   - Its role in OOP is to hide the internal details of an object and restrict access to certain components, promoting data integrity and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Key Principles of Encapsulation - Access Control and Data Hiding:**\n",
        "   - **Access Control:** Determines the visibility of members (attributes and methods) from outside the class.\n",
